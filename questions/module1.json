(10 marks)\n(i) Describe the structure of DNA and its role in storing genetic information. (3 marks)\n(ii) Outline the key stages of protein synthesis, including transcription and translation. (5 marks)\n(iii) Why is protein synthesis essential for cell function? (2 marks)",
          "answer": "(i) Structure of DNA and its role in storing genetic information:\n- DNA is a double helix composed of nucleotides, which contain a sugar-phosphate backbone and nitrogenous bases (A, T, C, G). The sequence of bases encodes genetic instructions that determine the structure and function of proteins.\n(ii) Key stages of protein synthesis:\n- Transcription (occurs in the nucleus):\n  - DNA is unzipped, and one strand is used as a template to form messenger RNA (mRNA).\n  - RNA polymerase helps build mRNA by pairing complementary bases (A-U, C-G).\n  - The mRNA strand leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm.\n- Translation (occurs in the cytoplasm at ribosomes):\n  - The mRNA binds to a ribosome, where transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring amino acids.\n  - tRNA matches codons on mRNA with anticodons, assembling amino acids in a specific sequence.\n  - The amino acids form a polypeptide chain, which folds into a functional protein.\n(iii) Why protein synthesis is essential for cell function:\n- Proteins play a crucial role in cell growth, repair, and enzyme function. Without protein synthesis, cells would be unable to produce enzymes, hormones, and structural proteins, leading to impaired function.",
