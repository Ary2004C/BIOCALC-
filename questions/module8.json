      "answer": "Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles responsible for ATP production. Their inner membrane folds into cristae to increase surface area for ATP synthesis.

      "answer": "Prokaryotic cells are unicellular organisms that lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They have a single circular DNA molecule and reproduce via binary fission. Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have a defined nucleus, multiple linear chromosomes, and various membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. They reproduce through mitosis or meiosis.",

      "answer": "Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. Prokaryotic DNA is circular and floats in the cytoplasm, whereas eukaryotic DNA is linear and enclosed within the nucleus. Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission, while eukaryotic cells divide by mitosis or meiosis. Additionally, prokaryotes often contain plasmids for extra genetic material, which eukaryotic cells lack. Both cell types contain ribosomes for protein synthesis. Eukaryotic cells are more complex because they have specialized organelles that allow compartmentalization of functions, making energy production and protein synthesis more efficient.",

      "answer": "The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins, cholesterol, and glycoproteins, forming a fluid mosaic model. The hydrophilic heads face outward, while the hydrophobic tails face inward, creating a selectively permeable barrier. Selective permeability ensures essential nutrients enter while waste exits, preventing harmful substances from disrupting cellular function. Active transport, such as the sodium-potassium pump, uses ATP to maintain ion balance, while passive transport, like osmosis, regulates water movement without energy expenditure, maintaining cell hydration.",

      "answer": "Cellular respiration consists of three stages: Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm and breaks glucose into pyruvate; the Krebs Cycle, which takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and produces electron carriers (NADH, FADH₂); and the Electron Transport Chain (ETC), which happens in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where ATP is generated. ATP provides energy for cellular functions such as muscle contraction and active transport. Aerobic respiration produces 36-38 ATP per glucose molecule, releasing CO₂ and H₂O, while anaerobic respiration yields only 2 ATP, producing lactic acid in animals and ethanol plus CO₂ in yeast and bacteria.",

      "answer": "Enzymes act as biological catalysts, speeding up metabolic reactions by lowering activation energy without being consumed. They work on specific substrates at their active sites, forming enzyme-substrate complexes. Temperature affects enzyme activity; optimal temperatures increase reaction rates, while extreme heat denatures enzymes. pH also influences activity, as deviations from the enzyme’s optimal pH can alter its shape. Substrate concentration impacts reaction rates, with increased substrate levels speeding up reactions until enzymes become saturated.",

      "answer": "Cells need a high surface-area-to-volume ratio to efficiently exchange materials like oxygen, nutrients, and waste across the cell membrane. A low ratio would slow diffusion, making it difficult to sustain cellular functions. One adaptation is the presence of microvilli in the intestines, which increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. Another adaptation is the flattened shape of red blood cells, allowing for more efficient gas exchange. These adaptations help optimize material exchange, supporting the organism’s survival.",
