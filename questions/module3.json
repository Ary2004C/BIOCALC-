      "question": "Which row of the table correctly identifies the process and reason for gene pool changes?",
      "options": [
        "Gene flow - Change in frequency of the b allele due to a mutation",
        "Genetic drift - Change in frequency of the b allele due to random events",
        "Gene flow - Introduction of more b alleles due to new members moving into the population",
        "Genetic drift - Introduction of more b alleles due to this allele being more advantageous"
      ],
      "answer": "Genetic drift - Change in frequency of the b allele due to random events",
      "explanation": "Genetic drift involves changes in allele frequency due to random events rather than selective pressure."
